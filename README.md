# Boris_Bikes :bike:

Task from Week 1 on the Makers bootcamp. This task was completed during daily pair-programming sessions with a new partner daily.

Day 1 partner --> [Courtney Stow](https://github.com/Court534) - Challenges 1 to 10 completed

## About the task
The task is to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on).

To help structure your work, here are 22 challenges. They all build on one another. They require you to research things, to get stuck, and to find your own solutions. This is on purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way for hours.
