# Boris_Bikes

Task from Week 1 on the Makers bootcamp.

## About the task
The task is to want build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

To help structure your work, here are 22 challenges. They all build on one another. They require you to research things, to get stuck, and to find your own solutions. This is on purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way for hours.

### Challenges
#### Challenge 1 - Setting up a project

- Extract a Domain Model from User Stories

#### Challenge 3 - From a domain model to a feature test
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Define 'Feature Test'
- Define a 'stack trace'
- Use `irb` to run a 'feature test'

#### Challenge 4 - Errors are good
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Explain how to use a stack trace to debug errors
- Debug an error using a stack trace

#### Challenge 5 - From feature tests to unit tests
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Define RSpec as a testing framework
- Create a spec file
- Describe an Object using a specification
- Set up a Unit Test

#### Challenge 6 - Passing your first unit test
**Learning Objectives covered**
- Pass a unit test
- Use `require`

#### Challenge 7 - Back to the feature
**Learning Objectives covered**
