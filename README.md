# Boris_Bikes :bike:

Task from Week 1 on the Makers bootcamp. This task was completed during daily pair-programming sessions with a new partner daily.

Day 1 partner --> [Courtney Stow](https://github.com/Court534) - Challenges 1 to 10 completed. We paired using the driver-navigator technique to push-pull commits to our own machines as we took turns.

Day 2 partner --> [Simon Jacobs](https://github.com/smoni19) - Challenges 7 to 12 completed. We picked up where Simon left off on Day 1, therefore we worked on his repository [which is here](https://github.com/smoni19/Boris_Bikes/commits/main) using the driver/navigator technique to push/pull commits as required. At the end of the day I updated my existing repository with the code we finished the day with.

## About the task
The task is to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on).

To help structure the work, we were given 22 challenges. They all built upon one another. They required us to research things, to get stuck, and to find our own solutions. This is was purpose. A developer is a 'knowledge worker' - someone who will spend the majority of their time researching and learning how to solve problems. It'll suck for a bit, but with practice, you will get faster: and there's no better feeling than finding the answer to a problem that's been standing in your way for hours.
